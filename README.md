# Innkside JavaScript Library (preview)

This is a preview of how will work the innkside javascript library **this library is not publised on npm yet**

## Usage
One of the objectives of this project is to make product creators and startups be able access to an efficient micropayment service quickly and easily.
Due to this We'll provide initially just 3 methods to work with this library.

### Initialize Client
This method will initialize the environment of the library to work with the rest of the methods, will be needed to provide an api key. You will be able to get one on the innkside dashboard.

```js
import innksideClient from 'innkside'

const API_KEY = '..apikey'

const innkside = innksideClient(API_KEY)
```

### Exchange Coins
This method will make your users able to exchange fiat currency into your internal coin (you can call it as you want in the dashboard)

```js

```
